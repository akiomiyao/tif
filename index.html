TIF detectes transposition of transpososable elements from sequence data of NGS.
<h2><i>Tos17</i> in last century</h2>
<p><img src = "tos17.gif" align = "left">
<i>Tos17</i> is an endogenous retrotransposon of rice. <i>Tos17</i> is active only in cultured cells of <i>japonica</i> rice cultivar Nipponbare (<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.93.15.7783" target = "_blank">Hirochika <i>et al.</i> 1996</a>). Taking advantage of this property, we created 50,000 lines of mutant panels from rice individuals regenerated from cultured cells (<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.012559" target = "_blank">Miyao <i>et al.</i> 2003</a>). Insertion sites of <i>Tos17</i> is determined by <a href = "https://doi.org/10.5511/plantbiotechnology.15.253" target = "_blank">the Suppression PCR method and TAIL-PCR method</a>, and is published in the <a href = "https://tos.nias.affrc.go.jp/" target = "_blank">mutant panel database</a>. <i>Tos17</i> insertion mutant lines have been distributed to researchers around the world and is <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=ja&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=tos17&btnG=" target = "_blank">useful for functional analysis of genes</a>.
<p>Before the development of NGS technology, primer set of a primer having a Tos17 sequence near the end of Tos17 and  a primer with a special modification at the end, or a short primer with the elaborate reaction cycles was used to amplify the DNA fragment containing the flanking sequence of Tos17 insertion point. Amplified fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA obtained from the gel block containing the fragment was used as a template to determine the flanking sequence of Tos17 insertion point by the Sanger method.
<p>We tried to determine the insertion position of Tos17 for all 50,000 lines. It was costly and required several years. Furthermore, amplification of flanking sequences depends on recognition sites of restriction enzyme or by-chance primer annealing, making it difficult to cover all insertion sites.
<h2>Tos17 in this century with NGS</h2>
<p>NGS technology has made it possible to obtain the entire genome sequence of rice individuals. The junction created by Tos17 insertion should also be included in the large number of short reads. Sequences having a junction with Tos17 can be easily selected by searching the sequences at both ends of Tos17. It is known that a 5-base duplication occurs at the target site during the insertion of Tos17. <a href = "https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-71/figures/1" target = "_blank">The insertion site of Tos17 can be known by selecting a set having the same 5-base target site duplication (TSD) in the 5'end-flanking sequence and the 3'end-flankng sequence of Tos17.</a>
